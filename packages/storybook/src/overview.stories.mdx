Reshoot is a production-ready image framework for React. As a spiritual successor of [`react-ideal-image`](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-ideal-image) (no longer actively maintained), Reshoot makes the generation and rendering of lazy-loaded responsive images as effortless and efficient as possible.

It is not just a library but a framework, because apart from a lightweight React component library, it is also shipped with a Webpack loader and a Babel macro that generate images in different sizes ([`srcset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)) as well as low-quality previews ([`lqip`](https://github.com/zouhir/lqip)).

Written in TypeScript, Reshoot provides type definitions out of the box. Powered by hooks and IntersectionObserver, its React runtime is only 4.5kb in size (`3kb` js and `1.5kb` css) before gzip. The built-in Babel macro also helps you override image generation setting while maintaining maximum code readability.

## What is in the box

Reshoot currently consists of the following 3 packages.

### `@reshoot/loader`

A [`webpack-loader`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders) that emits low-quality image preview ([`lqip`](https://github.com/zouhir/lqip)) and responsive images, and returns meta info of the images.

### `@reshoot/macro`

A [`babel-macro`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros) that transpile `reshoot('image.jpg', { a: 1, b: 2 })` into `require('image.jpg!@reshoot/loader?a=1&b=2')`.

### `@reshoot/react`

A lightweight [`React`](https://reactjs.org) component that renders lazy-loaded responsive images. It is designed to accept the output meta data of `@reshoot/loader`.

## Usage

Add the following loader config to Webpack config.

```javascript
{
  loader: '@reshoot/loader',
  options: {
    name: '[contenthash:8].[ext]',
    shape: { mime: false }
  }
}
```

Import `@reshoot/macro` and `@reshoot/react`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

import Reshoot from '@reshoot/react';
import reshoot from '@reshoot/macro';

sessionStorage.clear();

const color = '#FDDFB0';

function Example({ title }) {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h2 style={{ paddingLeft: 10 }}>{title}</h2>
      <div className="grid-container">
        <Reshoot {...reshoot('./image.jpg', { color })} />
        <Reshoot
          {...reshoot('./image.jpg', { color })}
          src="image.jpg"
          srcSet={null}
        />
        <Reshoot {...reshoot('./image.jpg', { color })} placeholder={false} />
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

render(
  <Example title="Client-side Rendered" />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Support

This library has been continuously used in many of my personal projects, and is regarded as production-ready. In the foreseeable future, I will continuously maintain and support this library.
